# Shared workflow

## 1. Define the outcome

ChatGPT converts the owner request into one owner-visible outcome with:

- measurable exit criterion;
- in-scope and non-goals;
- important invariants;
- required acceptance surfaces;
- explicit external-write authorization.

ChatGPT must actively challenge inferior or unsupported approaches and propose a
better bounded alternative. Agreement with the owner's first idea is not a
workflow goal.

## 2. Reuse before research

Before platform investigation:

1. search `skills/` for relevant capabilities;
2. record each selected skill's platform, maturity and last verification;
3. run its bounded freshness/compatibility gate against current authoritative
   source/runtime;
4. search current proven donor apps for the complete integration boundary;
5. investigate only the missing or changed delta.

A stale/absent skill triggers investigation; it does not justify guessing from
memory. A current verified skill should normally eliminate a full repeat audit.

## 3. Establish exact baseline

Codex Local records repository, branch, HEAD, full dirty state, reference
revisions, linked worktrees, environment IDs and permissions. Preserve owner
changes. Use an isolated worktree when necessary rather than cleaning the owner
checkout.

Codex gives the primary implementation agent the compact task controller plus
exact canonical context/skill paths. Do not paste the whole knowledge base into
every prompt.

## 4. Implement one coherent outcome

Current default primary implementer: DeepSeek.

The implementer:

1. follows the real production flow;
2. identifies the first confirmed mismatch or approved design boundary;
3. reuses current skills/reference implementations where compatible;
4. makes the smallest robust coherent change;
5. runs project-defined checks;
6. executes every accessible required real-runtime validation layer;
7. performs adversarial self-audit and remediates confirmed in-scope
   BLOCKER/HIGH findings.

Do not silently expand into unrelated refactors or platform modifications.

## 5. Review and escalation

Codex Local checks the handoff against the exact application revision. Routine
work gets a bounded handoff review. Independent review is required for high-risk
authority/data-integrity work, repeated failures and release-critical changes.
If Codex implemented the change, its own review is not independent.

Escalate after two failed implementation attempts or one failed correction of an
owner runtime failure. Expensive/high-reasoning agents should be used where risk
or difficulty justifies them, not for routine repository reading/build loops.

## 6. Owner/runtime acceptance

Execute all accessible required acceptance steps. An owner-only action remains
explicitly pending. Unit, mock, lint, typecheck, build and local preview never
prove embedded Hub/Home or deployed QDN behavior.

For “all”, “everywhere” or “app-wide”, enumerate every relevant surface in the
controller and validate each.

## 7. Capability harvest

Before final handoff run
[`skills/shared/capability-harvest/SKILL.md`](skills/shared/capability-harvest/SKILL.md).

If the task discovered or corrected a reusable capability:

```text
project finding
-> identify reusable boundary
-> source/runtime evidence
-> create/update canonical skill
-> set maturity
-> define invalidation/freshness test
-> record skill path in handoff
```

This closes the compounding loop: each solved project should make later projects
cheaper when the solved knowledge is actually reusable.

## 8. Handoff and completion

Return a truthful handoff with exact application SHA, evidence by validation
layer, missing evidence, owner acceptance, external-write state and skill
harvest result. The handoff must name the agent that actually executed the work;
identity is never inferred from a template or an orchestration role (see
[GIT-AND-HANDOFF.md](GIT-AND-HANDOFF.md)). Only verified acceptance permits
completion. Publishing/merging/releasing is a separate authorized step.

Use [GIT-AND-HANDOFF.md](GIT-AND-HANDOFF.md) for machine-readable state. Platform
application reports stay in their platform-defined canonical locations;
universal orchestration research/audits belong under this repository.

## New application default

Use the functional bootstrap skill unless the product requires another proven
architecture:

```text
neutral functional shell
-> platform/QDN/auth/routing/data flows
-> tests + real host/runtime smoke
-> project-specific visual identity and polish
```

Do not impose one visual identity across owner apps. The reusable shell should be
replaceable at the presentation layer.

## Starting/resuming shorthand

Starting or resuming needs only: project ID + one outcome + this contract path.
For an unregistered project, discover the actual Qortal/Qortium repository and
platform context, add a registry row, then create only the thin routing/context
needed. Do not move or reinitialize an existing project to fit a preferred tree.
